/**
 * Hands the tile React, MUI and gui-components from the devices app, not from its own bundle.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The devices app does not share React through Module Federation. It creates its federation
 * instance with `shared: {}` and puts its modules on `window.__iobrokerShared__` instead
 * (`ioBroker.devices`, `src-admin/src/WidgetsManager/pluginLoader.ts`), because proxy-wrapped
 * shared modules caused trouble in production builds there.
 *
 * So a tile that simply imports `react` would get a copy bundled into itself - a second React.
 * A class component survives that; a hook does not: `useState` from one React called while the
 * other one is rendering fails with "Invalid hook call". The views this tile reuses from the admin
 * tab are all hooks, so every import of these packages is redirected to a small module that reads
 * the devices app's own copy from that global.
 *
 * ## Why the export list is collected, not written out
 *
 * `@mui/icons-material` alone has over ten thousand exports; re-exporting all of them would put
 * every name into the bundle. Writing the list by hand would go stale the first time somebody adds
 * an import to a shared view. So the names are read out of the sources at build time, and each
 * redirect module exports exactly the names something actually imports.
